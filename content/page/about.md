My name is Spenser Pothier, I live in Seattle, WA. I am an engineer and I help create software on all platforms. 

{{< fa fa-briefcase >}} I have been working at [Nordstrom](https://nordstrom.com) since July of 2015 and have been working on all sorts of projects utilizing Go, Kubernetes, Chef, Ruby, and various other tools for increased automation and reliability.

{{< fa fa-graduation-cap >}} I went to the [University of Washington - Bothell](http://uwb.edu/css) to pursue a degree in Computing and Software Systems

{{< fa fa-heart >}} I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking and backpaking with my wife and sharing it on our blog, [Aimless Wonderers](http://www.aimlesswonderers.com). I also enjoy staying at home hanging out with our pets, playing games with friends, and working on improving our house and garden.

{{< fa fa-code >}} I am always trying to learn new technologies, but lately my focus has been on [Go](https://golang.org) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)

{{< fa fa-file-text-o >}} My [projects page](/project/) is where you can see a number of side projects I've worked on. You can also view my most recently update resume [here](/spenser_resume_latest.pdf)
