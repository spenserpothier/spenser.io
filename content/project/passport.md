I decided I wanted to learn how to write applications for Android, so I came up with a project that was simple enough to complete on my own in a fairly short amount of time, yet a broad enough topic to demonstrate learning a wide variety of things about the Android SDK. This application is a port of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook_%28application%29" target="_blank">Passbook</a> application for iOS. It has support for the 5 differnt types of passbooks that can be generated (Boarding Pass, Coupon, Event Ticket, Generic, and Store Cards). It does not support Apple Pay, or updates via Apple Push Notification Services.<br/>
