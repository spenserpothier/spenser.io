As of 2025-08-26, here is how I've used generative AI/LLM tools.

---
I use [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) mostly for fixing or creating new things in the theme of this website. Occasionaly I've used it for brainstorming, but anything posted on this website unless explicitly specified otherwise was created by me.

The point of this page is to let you know that nothing claiming to be written by me on this site is written by an AI/LLM.

If this changes in the future, Iâ€™ll update this page at this permanent URL: https://spenser.io/ai
