Finally getting around to setting up my own personal site, hopefully this time I can keep it updated. I've set it up using wordpress for ease of use and that might keep me motivated to make some posts and stuff. In fact, for my first post beyond the traditional "Hello world!" I will be writing up the process that I used to setup this site and blog.
