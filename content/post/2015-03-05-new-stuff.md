I've been updating the site! I've added a <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> section, updated resume, and started working on my first Android application, <a href="/passport/index.html">Passport</a> (tenative name). I'll be adding more details to the project page as I get closer to the release. I also hope to add a few posts about what I learned throughout building the app.
