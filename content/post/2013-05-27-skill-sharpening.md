After reading <a href="https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2" target="_blank">this blog post</a> I have decided that I'm going to basically rewrite all of my old college homework assignments of all of the basic data structures and algorithms. Some of them I might even attempt in multiple languages.
So here is the list that I plan on working through. I will update this page, and probably add it to the projects page when I get around to making that.

Data Structures:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Linked List</li>
	<li>Stack and Queue</li>
	<li>Binary Search Tree</li> 
	<li>Circular Queue</li>
	<li>Hash map</li>
	<li>Set</li>
	<li>Priority Queue</li>
	<li>More as I think of them/find them</li>
</ul>

Algorithms:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Dijkstra's</li>
	<li>Binary Search</li>
	<li>Bubble/Selection/Insertion/Quick Sort</li>
	<li>More as I think of them/find them</li>
</ul>
