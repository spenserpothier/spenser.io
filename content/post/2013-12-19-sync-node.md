While working on a deployment script, I had a series of shell commands that needed to be run in sequence. I looked around quite a while for an elegant way of doing that but no one seemed to have one until I stumbled upon <a href="http://geekindex.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/run-multiple-shell-commands-synchronously-in-nodejs/">this site</a> which had an extremely simple way to do so using the Async library. I modified it a little bit to show the output of the shell command for use in logging.

var async = require('async');

  function execSync() {

    async.series([
      execFn('pwd'),
      execFn('ls -l'),
      execFn('ps -a')
    ]);
  }

  var execFn = function(cmd, dir) {
    return function(cb) {
      console.log('EXECUTING: ' + cmd);
      exec(cmd, function(error, stdout, stderr) {
        sys.print("$" + stdout);
        sys.print("stderr: " + stderr)
        cb();
      });
    }
  }

  execSync();
